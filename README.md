- About the app <br>
Our movie application, called dotMOV, uses The Movie DB API to provide users with a wide selection of movies to browse through. Users can search for specific movies or simply browse through different genres. Users are also able to instantly search for a movie no matter what page they are visiting. Additionally, users can create an account and log in to keep track of their favorite movies, allowing them to easily find and view details of them later. Overall, the app makes it easy for movie enthusiasts to find and keep track of the movies they love.

- Current Status <br>
    Currently, our application is serving its purpose and we were able to complete all the requirements we set for ourselves. Some extra features we had in mind such as adding a profile section which would display the user favorites as well as allow user to change their personal information was not developed due to time constraints.
